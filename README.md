# Deskmate

Deskmate is a hardwired, desk-mounted, seven-key macropad. It can be powered with whatever MCU you want to use but the case is designed to have a Raspberry Pi Pico mounted inside of it.

The way the cable is routed is less than ideal and could use some adjustments; specifically the fact that I had to add a cutout inside the case for the cable to bend.
